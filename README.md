# Spatial-Heterogeneity

## Description

This GitHub Repository contains the code for the following project in which I collaborated with Dr. Miguel Acevedo during the period comprehending between July 2015 and May 2016.The following abstract is for reference only, and doesn't represent the actual status of the project. 

Title: Hosts have similar probabilities of being infected

Mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) are prevalent in nature causing more than 17% of all infectious diseases in humans.  They are also responsible for regulating other vertebrate host populations and mediating species coexistence.  Mathematical models help us improve our understanding of the complex relationship between hosts, vectors and pathogens. Most models assume homogenous mixing--that all hosts have the same probability of being infected. Homogeneous mixing may be rare in nature where just a small number of individuals are responsible for most of the infections.  These highly infective individuals may correspond to particular stage classes or may live clustered in space with some sites with high probability of infection and some with low probability of infection. To test the hypothesis that infective individuals are clustered in space violating an important assumption of classical models, we studied lizard-malaria infections in El Verde Field Station where three Plasmodium species naturally infect Anolis gundlachi. A. gundlachi forages in the ground and in the trees in the montane forests of Puerto Rico. We examined the distribution of the trees where lizards forage (N=1,294) in a primary growth forest, which showed a clumped distribution. Then, we examined the distribution of lizards (N=122), correcting for body size. We found that both the lizard host and infections were spatially clustered. Our results suggest that infections are spatially heterogeneous violating important assumptions of MBD theoretical models.
